### Solving Psychopath Mazes!

There's a really interesting maze game that was published in 2005.  It's called Psychopath.

Check it out here!:

#Unfortunately, as of writing, it is impossible to register for this version, so if you don't have an account, it's going to be really aggravating trying to keep your progress saved.  That said, if you already have an account, this is the coolest version to play the game on and you should stick with it.

#However, if not, you can register for psychopath2... and you'll have access to all of the Psychopath 1 levels and can see any levels that I am talking about...

As of writing, only 39 users have cleared all of the levels in the original game.  This is partly due to the fact that it is impossible to register as of a few years ago.  

I am one of the people who has cleared all the levels, and while it's interesting to solve a bunch of mazes using logic and intuition as a person, I'm excited to attempt what I believe to be far more difficult -- writing a bot that could also beat all of the levels.

The first few levels aren't all that interesting and are just like a regular maze that a mouse might
learn to solve in its search for cheese or peanut butter, but in the double digits, ESPECIALLY around level 30,
things get extremely interesting due to the addition of movable blocks.
